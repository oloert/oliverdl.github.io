I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [McMaster University](https://www.economics.mcmaster.ca/)

My research intersts are in Macroeconomics, Environmental Economics and International Economics.

I am on the job market during the 2024-25 academic year and available for interviews.

## Job Market Paper

<div id="jmpAbstract" style="display:none;"><p>The global push to move away from fossil fuels carries significant implications for countries with significant resource extraction sectors. In this paper I develop a quantitative model of a two region, multisector small open resource-rich economy with heterogeneous households. I calibrate the model to Canadian data to quantify the welfare impacts of vanishing global demand for fossil inputs and growth in clean energy adoption. I validate the model by applying it to the observed increase in oil prices between 1997-2020. Consistent with the data and existing literature, my model produces stronger wage growth in the fossil producing region, and overall welfare gains out of the 2000s oil price boom. The model predicts negligible welfare losses when the global demand for fossil fuels decreases over a period of 30 years.</p></div>

<div id="cjeAbstract" style="display:none;"><p>We study the behaviour of Canadian Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth over the past 60 years. We find that the observed stagnation during the last 20 years is entirely accounted for by the Oil sector. Higher oil prices made capital-intensive sources of oil like the oil sands viable to extract on a commercial scale. However, the greater input required per barrel of oil slowed TFP growth. Comparing Canadian TFP growth to those of the United States and Norway reinforces these results. However, our result should not be interpreted to carry any welfare implications.</p></div>
