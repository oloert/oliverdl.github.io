<div id="jmpAbstract" style="display:none;"><p>The global transition to clean energy carries significant implications for countries with large resource extraction sectors. I evaluate the welfare impact of falling global demand for fossil fuels and an expanding clean energy sector in small, resource-rich economies. I develop a quantitative model of a two-region, multisector, small open  economy with heterogeneous households featuring both fossil and clean production. Calibrating the model to Canadian data, I find that the transition to a Net Zero world by 2050 produces heterogeneous welfare losses across the age and income distribution. However, faster growth in the clean or non-energy sectors can make the transition welfare-enhancing.</p></div>

<div id="cjeAbstract" class="paper-link-div" style="display:none;"><p>We study the behaviour of Canadian Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth over the past 60 years. We find that the observed stagnation during the last 20 years is entirely accounted for by the Oil sector. Higher oil prices made capital-intensive sources of oil like the oil sands viable to extract on a commercial scale. However, the greater input required per barrel of oil slowed TFP growth. Comparing Canadian TFP growth to those of the United States and Norway reinforces these results. However, our result should not be interpreted to carry any welfare implications.</p></div>

<div id="ricardoAbstract" class="paper-link-div" style="display:none;"><p><strong><em>Preliminary: </em></strong>How does product concentration affect welfare gains from trade? While traditional quantitative trade models can account for export concentration, they are unable to adequately match import concentration, particularly the fact that richer countries import a greater variety of goods. In this paper we enrich a multi-country Ricardian model of international trade to match both import and export concentration. Our model is also able to account for changes in the Least Traded Products margin (as defined in Kehoe and Ruhl, 2013) after a trade liberalization.</p></div>
